In the internet lingo, it's often used to describe a state of being where you're indulging in your own pleasures, without a care for societal norms or expectations. It's all about doing what you enjoy, even if it's deemed as lazy or unconventional. It can be staying in all day in your comfy clothes, playing video games, or eating snacks. It's a bit of a goofy concept, but it's all about embracing your own fun and quirks. Are you considering going into goblin mode, Gabe?"

So, permanently being in \"goblin mode\" would mean constantly living life on your own terms, indulging in what makes you happy, and not concerning yourself with societal expectations. That sounds like quite a liberating lifestyle! Maybe we could all use a bit of goblin mode in our lives. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other quirky terms you want to explore?"
